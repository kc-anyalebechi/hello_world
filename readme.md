### Timeline: 

[Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1O5VuscEf8ohC1nn2TTTToeInjdK7XL0C/view?usp=sharing) is the image of my timelime, features, and MVP's. 

I added 30 minutes to each feature because after completing the draft I thought I might have been a bit too obstemistic about my times. 

---
### MVP's:  

* A, B, C, (D) <-- on the image D is listed as a low priority however I believe D acutally has a higher priority than originally listed. 

### Non-MVP's
* F, H, I
